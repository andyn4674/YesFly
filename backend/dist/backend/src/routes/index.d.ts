 * Route definitions for the drone flight restriction API
 *
 * This module defines all API endpoints and their middleware.
 * It provides a clean separation between routing logic and
 * controller logic, making the codebase more maintainable.
 *
 * Routes follow REST conventions:
 * - POST /api/restrictions - Get flight restrictions
 * - GET /api/health - Health check
 * - GET /api/docs - API documentation
