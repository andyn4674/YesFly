a web app that takes in a location via browser geolocation or user input and returns a map showing in a radius areas that drone flying is permitted and restricted

the app will ask to use the user's location or for a location and use the OpenStreetMap Nominatum API to get coordinates
the app will determine the political juridictions of the location and fetch the GIS APIs needed via web using an AI agent (openrouter)
the app will use OpenStreetMap to create polygons of permission on a map with canvas rendering for dense urban environments and standard OSM raster tiles for other areas based on the number of parcels
the app will render the map

TBD
option to sign in and save the map if the process takes too long
